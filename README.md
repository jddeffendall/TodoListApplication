# Todo List Application
### Team 2: Haden Foster, Ross Effinger, Jacob Deffendall, Jordan Becker, Payton Lowry
#### User Stories
* As a user, I want to create a Todo list to keep track of all my tasks.
  *	I can create new Todo items, and be given reminders about them when I get on the application so I can keep track of and complete my schedule.
  * I can tell the app when I complete an item and it will be marked as completed.
  * I can snooze an item to give myself more time to complete it.
* As a user, I want to save my Todo list to my device so I can use the app offline so I can still keep track of my tasks offline.
  * I can also view a pie chart of all of my tasks, so I can see the progress I've made along with what still needs completed.
